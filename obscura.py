# research and modeling --steps

# --basic model
alerts: hard easy 
time: 
sets: generaive (chinese rest. process, fp-tree, rete, prie)
data sources: smallvslarge, ICU, patient-remission
how to model these, what needs to considered?
recommendation system(svd): what combo of alerts to notice in a patient

# disease model

# --(exploratory) -> multivariate
workflow: tree-diagram
copulas -> think hydrology
pca/svd


# --loss function -> posterior
