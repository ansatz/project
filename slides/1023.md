# motivation:
- Medical alerts provide positive benefits: reduced blood sugar variability, improved prescribing safety
- Joint Commision and FDA statement recognizing need for improvement 
- current alert fatigue(estimate of alerts ignored) at 70-80%

	>

		(1)To test our hypotheses that, dynamical weights of boosting associated with the high entropy, 
		nearer to classification boundaries, relates to clinical points of interest
		(2)To increase the number of alerts relating to care and management of patients clinical state and 
		minimize alerts which do not
		(3)To provide criteria for meaningful medical use relating to effect size, feature variability, 
		and group differences

# dataset 
- 2 datasets were obtained
- telehealth
- ICU 
	survival_curve (kaplan-meier)

#alert classification labels
- bayes credible intervals
- association mapping
- generative mixture
- roulette method
- mcmc: 'hot-streak', sampling

# hard vs easy
- boosting

# bayes
- bayes action(pt estimate)
- design loss function 
- causal modeling
- multiple hypoth testing


# Priors
- kernel density estimate
- expert priors, roulette method
- Weibull (rate_time_to_failure)

# big data
- calibration: 2 groups ICU, at-home telehealth
- validation: convergence of posterior

# power curve analysis
- effect size

# joint posterior distribution
- graph of hard vs easy posteriors


# causal modeling
- time_of_day, gender, geography
- features
- generative model(latent model)
- inferring causation (p447 35.3)

# model comparison
- deviance (x2 , least-square-residual)
- simposon paradox (mcauley )
- occam factor (marginilization, mcauley)

# hierarchical model
- feature selection

# decision analysis
- prediction of care = P(#alert_distribution) + P(time_between_alerts)_weibull_prior + P(#alerts_unseen)
- cost optimization

# rate alert fatigue reduction
- comparison
- DIAS: diabetes; Watson: cancer; MYCIN: general internal med

		results


# meaningful
- statistical space vs biological space
- mean shift time series (iSAX)
- p_hard_+topfeature vs p_easy_+topfeature





# decision analysis
- dr monty - updated posterior 
- opt-bid - max expected return over posterior distribution
- P(INTV) - probability(intervention)=distribution_over_alerts + distribution_time_between



# future work
- logical depth (lanforth)

- visualiztion (recurrence)
	- marginal entropies (contour plots)

- disease modeling
	- boosting_on_a_budget_mab

- HARNESS
