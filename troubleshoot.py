#***TROUBLESHOOT***<br>
#I seem to be having alot of trouble with the modules and keeping the sys
#up-to-date configured.  It will be alot of work to use auto-tools like chef,
#puppet; therefore, I just have to be careful.  Easier said then done at this point.

#***main functions:*** <br>
#return a WTS,
boost_real()
fit()
_boost_real_depr
fit_depr()

#***s3 vs sdbw2*** <br>
#no difference ?
